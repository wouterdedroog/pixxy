# Pixxy

Pixxy is a physical remote control for PixMob bracelets using a custom PCB, based on a Raspberry Pi Pico and MicroPython.
The PCB design is available in the [pixxy-kicad](pixxy-kicad) folder. I used KiCad 8 to design this PCB.

## Current state
I ordered an initial version of the PCB. This PCB has a 4Ã—4 button array, nine of these buttons are used for selecting
colours. The ninth button selects the colour currently selected by the three potentiometers above the buttons (RV1, RV2
and RV3). The input from these potentiometers meters will be used to generate an RGB colour.

The Fade and Flash buttons are used to send the command to the IR LED (connected to a 2N3904 transistor). The Once / 
Repeat selector can be used to send the command once or continuously.

For X2 bracelets (the ones being used at Taylor Swift concerts), it is possible to set a colour indefinitely. The On and 
Off buttons are used for this. The Taylor End button sends the end/go home signal used at concerts, which causes the
bracelet to loop through a set of colours until the battery runs out. The rainbow effect does the same effect, but with
all colours of the rainbow in order.

When the Speed Set button is held down, the value of the RV3 potentiometer influences the speed of the commands. This 
means the potentiometer influences how long a fade or flash command lasts, and how much time is in between these commands if the switch is in
the repeat position.

## Thanks
This project wouldn't have been possible without the research available in the 
[pixmob-ir-reverse-engineering](https://github.com/danielweidman/pixmob-ir-reverse-engineering/) and 
[PixMob_IR](https://github.com/jamesw343/PixMob_IR/) repositories. The knowledge available in the
[PIXMOD Discord](https://discord.com/invite/UYqTjC7xp3) has also been super helpful.
